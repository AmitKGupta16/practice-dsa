    Recursion : - Solving larger problems using smaller similar subproblems.

    Sum[N] = 1+2+3+4+5+.....+N-1+N

    Sum[N] = Sum[N-1] + N -> Recursive rotation.

    Ques: Write Recursive function for sum of N natural numbers.

    Assumption : Decide what your function does.

    Main Logic: Recursive relation to code breaking big problems into smaller subproblems.

    Base condition/Terminating condition: Smallest problem which you already know the answer.
