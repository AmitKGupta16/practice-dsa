1. Given N item with profit Vli and Wti. A bag is given with capacity W to carry some objects
   such that total weight <=W and maximize the profit in bag.

   Fractional Knapsack : Can pick the item only once and pick the item fractionally.

index             0   1   2
N = 3      Wti   10  20   30
W = 50     Vli   60  100  120
   ProfitPerKg   6   5    4

   ProfitPerKg = Vl/Wt

   if we pick the item by max value the profit will be for W=50 is Vl of 100+120 = 120

   We need think, can we maximize the profit.

   Now we will pick the item based on the max profit per kg.
   so, picked Vl of 60+100 + ((w)20*(profit/kg)4)= 240
   We achieved max profit and up the W =50;

Idea :  Calculate profit per kg for every item. Sort the item based the profit per kg ratio.

class Item {
   Integer weight;
   Integer Value;
   Double  profitPerKg;

   public Double(Integer weight, Integer value) {
       this.weight =weight;
       this.profit = profit;
       this.profitPerKg = profit/(double)weight;
   }
}
