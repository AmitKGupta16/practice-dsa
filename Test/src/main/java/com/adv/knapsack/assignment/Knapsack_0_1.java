/*Problem Description
        Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.

        Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.

        Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

        NOTE:

        You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).


        Problem Constraints
        1 <= N <= 10^3

        1 <= C <= 10^3

        1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^3



        Input Format
        First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.

        Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.

        Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.



        Output Format
        Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.



        Example Input
        Input 1:

        A = [60, 100, 120]
        B = [10, 20, 30]
        C = 50
        Input 2:

        A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
        B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
        C = 10


        Example Output
        Output 1:

        220
        Output 2:

        0


        Example Explanation
        Explanation 1:

        Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
        Explanation 2:

        Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.*/
